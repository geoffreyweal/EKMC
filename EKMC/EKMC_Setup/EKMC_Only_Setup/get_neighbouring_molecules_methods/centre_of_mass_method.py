	This method will obtain neighbouring pairs of molecules in the crystal based on the distances between their centre of masses.

	Parameters
	----------
	molecules : list of ase.Atoms objects
		These are all the individual molecules identified in the crystal that you want to determine neighbouring pairs of molecules for.
	max_neighbour_distance : float.
		This is the maximum distance that the centre of mass between two molecules can be to be considered a neighbouring pair of molecules. Given in Ã…. 

	Returns

		This is a list of all the neighbouring pairs of molecules identified.
