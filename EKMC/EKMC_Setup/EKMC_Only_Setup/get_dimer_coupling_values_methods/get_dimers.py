	This method will obtain all the dimers that are in unit cells, where the unit cells are within long_range_rCut of each other. 

	Parameters
	----------
	molecules : list of ase.Atoms
		This is a list of all the molecules in your crystal
	crystal_cell_lattice : ase.Cell
		This is the unit cell matrix
	long_range_rCut : float.
		Any molecule pairs within this distance of each other will have a coupling given by the large-range coupling model.
		
	Returns

	A tuple containing the name of the two molecules in the dimer, and their relative cell ijk difference from molecule 1 --> molecule 2
