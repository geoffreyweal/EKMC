	"""
	This method will determine if two molecules that are a relative cell distance away (given by cell_point) are within range of eachother.

	Parameters
	----------
	molecule1 : ase.Atoms
		This is the first molecule to compare.  This molecule will be found in the (0,0,0) relative unit cell.
	molecule2 : ase.Atoms
		This is the second molecule to compare. This molecule will be found in the (cell_point) relative unit cell.
	cell_point : 3 tuple
		This is the relative cell distance that molecule1 and molecule2 are from each other. 
	crystal_cell_lattice : ase.Cell
		This is the unit cell matrix
	short_range_rCut : float.
		Any molecule pairs within this distance of each other will have a coupling given by the short-range coupling model.
	long_range_rCut : float.
		Any molecule pairs within this distance of each other will have a coupling given by the large-range coupling model.
	rCut_mol_dist_description : str.
		This is the description given to how the distance between two molecules is obtained. 
		
	Returns
	------- 
		'Short Range' : dimer_distance <= short_range_rCut
		'Long Range'  : short_range_rCut < dimer_distance <= long_range_rCut
		None          : long_range_rCut < dimer_distance
