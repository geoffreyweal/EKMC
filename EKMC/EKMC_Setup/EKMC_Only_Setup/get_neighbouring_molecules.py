	"""
	This method is designed to obtain all the molecules that neighbour each molecule in the original unit cell within some distance. 

	Parameters
	----------
	molecules : list of ase.Atoms objects.
		These are all the individual molecules identified in the crystal that you want to determine dimers for.
	molecule_graphs : list of networkx.graphs
		These are all the graphs that describe the bonding network in each molecule in the molecules list. 
	dimer_method : dict.
		This is the information used to create dimers from the molecules in the crystal.
	environment_settings : dict.
		This is the information used to determine the molecules that surround each molecules in the crystal. 
	include_hydrogens_in_neighbour_analysis: bool. 
		This tag indicates if you want to include hydrogens when accessing neighbours between molecules. Default: False
	no_of_cpus : int.
		This is the number of cpus available to use on this program. In most cases this should just be set to 1 cpu, however for very large system you may want to implement multiple cpus.

	Returns
	-------
	neighbourhood_molecules_for_dimer_method : list
		This is a list of all the dimers identified, given as the tuple (index of molecule 1 in molecules list, index of molecule 1 in molecules list, molecule 1, molecule 2). 
	neighbourhood_molecules_for_environment_method : list
		This is a list of all the environmental list of neighbouring olecule pairs identified, given as the tuple (index of molecule 1 in molecules list, index of molecule 1 in molecules list, molecule 1, molecule 2).
